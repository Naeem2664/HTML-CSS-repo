			<h1><mark color="blue">BookShop Article</mark></h1>
			<p>A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as ID number, author, title, price publisher and stock position. Whenever a customer wants a book, the sales person inputs the ID and the system searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If the requested copies are available then will display; otherwise the message “Book not found” will display.<br>
            Book Store Management System is the windows application to automate all kinds of operations in the book shop. The purpose of this software is to manage the books in the book store. Generally, it includes the Order Processing, Stock Management . We developed this software to maintains records of books. This project developed only C++.<br>
            At the start of the business, the books store owner buys the book from the dealers. All the name of the books is noted down in the software along with rate. In the present system user has to do all work manually. In present system During issuing order of more stock, the product register is required to check to availability of stock in hand. And it takes time to check records<br>
            The task is to build the bookshop management system using file handling in C++that helps to keep track of all the book records in a file. Below are the features to be implemented:</p>
<h2>Aproach</h2>
<pre><b><strong><u>Add new book and the details of the book are:</strong></b></u>

<i><b>1.	DISPLAY BOOKS.
2.	CHECK PARTICULAR BOOK
3.	UPDATE BOOK
4.	DELETE BOOK
5.	EXIT<b></i>
Approach:
All the functions will be provided under switch cases
The concept of file handling will be used to write the data in a text file and read the written data as well.
The required function will be written under the switch cases which will be executed as per the input of the user.
Simple file handing concepts like opening a file, closing a file, writing in a file and reading the file, etc. are used to develop the code.
